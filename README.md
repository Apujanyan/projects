# Projects

### Advanced Banking System Simulation:

Write a program that simulates a bank system. The program should have classes for accounts, customers, and transactions.
Accounts should have attributes such as account number, balance, and account type (e.g., checking, savings). Customers
should have attributes such as name and contact information. Transactions should have attributes such as the account 
being debited/credited, the amount, and the transaction type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal). The program should allow 
customers to manage their accounts, view transaction history, and transfer funds. Use interfaces to implement classes 
for different types of accounts (e.g., individual, joint) and abstract classes for banking operations.

### Complex Car Dealership System:

Write a program that simulates a car dealership system. The program should have classes for cars, customers, and 
salespeople. Cars should have attributes such as make, model, and price. Customers should have attributes such as name 
and contact information. Salespeople should have attributes such as name and commission rate. The program should allow 
salespeople to manage car inventory, customers to search for and purchase cars, and salespeople to view their sales 
history. Use interfaces to implement classes for different types of cars (e.g., electric, hybrid) and abstract classes 
for sales operations.

### Restaurant Ordering System with Enhanced Features:

Write a program that simulates a restaurant ordering system. The program should have classes for menus, orders, and 
customers. Menus should have attributes such as dishes and prices. Orders should have attributes such as the customer 
ordering, the dishes being ordered, and the total price of the order. Customers should have attributes such as name and
contact information. The program should allow customers to view the menu, place orders, and view their order history. 
Use inheritance to implement classes for different types of dishes (e.g., appetizers, entrees) and abstract classes for 
menu operations.

### Sophisticated Music Streaming Service:

Write a program that simulates a music streaming service. The program should have classes for songs, albums, and 
playlists. Songs should have attributes such as title, artist, and length. Albums should have attributes such as title,
artist, and release date. Playlists should have attributes such as name and songs included. The program should allow 
users to search for and listen to songs, create and manage playlists, and view their listening history. Use interfaces 
to implement classes for different types of music (e.g., rock, pop) and abstract classes for music operations.

### University Course Management System with Advanced Features:

Write a program that simulates a university course management system. The program should have classes for courses, 
students, and professors. Courses should have attributes such as name, instructor, and content. Students should have 
attributes such as name and contact information. Professors should have attributes such as name and contact information.
The program should allow professors to create and manage courses, and students to enroll in courses, complete 
assignments, and view their progress. Use interfaces to implement classes for different types of courses 
(e.g., undergraduate, graduate) and abstract classes for course assignments.

### Comprehensive Hospital Management System:

Write a program that simulates a hospital management system. The program should have classes for patients, doctors, 
and medical staff. Patients should have attributes such as name, age, and medical history. Doctors should have 
attributes such as name and contact information. Medical staff should have attributes such as name and position. 
The program should allow doctors to manage patient information and appointments, and medical staff to manage hospital
operations. Use inheritance to implement classes for different types of medical procedures (e.g., surgeries, check-ups)
and abstract classes for medical operations.

### Movie Rental System with Advanced Features:

Write a program that simulates a movie rental system. The program should have classes for movies, customers, and 
rentals. Movies should have attributes such as title, genre, and rating. Customers should have attributes such as name 
and contact information. Rentals should have attributes such as the customer renting the movie, the movie being rented,
and the rental duration. The program should allow customers to search for and rent movies, view their rental history, 
and return movies. Use interfaces to implement classes for different types of movies (e.g., comedy, drama) and abstract 
classes for rental operations.

### Advanced E-Commerce Platform:

Write a program that simulates an e-commerce platform. The program should have classes for products, customers, and 
orders. Products should have attributes such as name, price, and description. Customers should have attributes such as 
name and contact information. Orders should have attributes such as the customer placing the order, the products being
ordered, and the total price of the order. The program should allow customers to search for and purchase products, view 
their order history, and leave reviews. Use inheritance to implement classes for different types of products 
(e.g., electronics, clothing) and abstract classes for order operations.
